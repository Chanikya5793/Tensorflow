# Tensorflow

This website predicts the number drawn on the canvas

Front end app built on React and running on a docker container with production build

the website can be accessed at: https://photos.chanakyachowdary.in/React

if the above doesnt work try:   https://photos.chanakyachowdary.in/Tensorflow  its just a simple html page to check and debug issues with tensorflow model and server and it should work fine if model loading error occured on the React App site

Small note:

The server is running on a docker container on my MacBook, so,

If anytime the server is down, probably:

1. I stopped the container
2. My public IP changed (cron apparently is not working fine to update my dns so i need to run the script manually)
3. It no longer exists

Just reachout to me at admin@chanakyachowdary.in so thati can help u out or turn back on the server
